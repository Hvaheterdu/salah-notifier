# Salah Notifier

The **Salah Notifier** is an Arduino-based device that displays daily prayer times on an LCD screen and plays the adhan (call to prayer) through a speaker when it‚Äôs time to pray.

## üìñ Overview

This project was created to make it easier to keep track of prayer times without needing to constantly check a phone or website. The device shows both the current time and the next prayer time, and automatically plays the adhan when a prayer begins.  

It‚Äôs placed in a central location ‚Äî such as the kitchen ‚Äî so the adhan can be heard from most areas of the house.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

The Arduino is housed in a 3D-printed case designed with a slot for a 16x2 LCD display. The speaker is mounted externally through small openings in the case and secured with tape.

- The **LCD display** and **speaker** were purchased from eBay.  
- In Norway, daily prayer times are retrieved via the [bonnetid.no](https://bonnetid.no) API.  
- Prayer times are updated automatically each day at **01:00 AM**, since they vary from day to day.  
- An **SD card module** stores the adhan as an MP3 file. The adhan plays for approximately **18 seconds** at the start of each prayer time.

The LCD display shows:
- **Top line:** Current date and time  
- **Bottom line:** Next prayer time (alternating every 3 seconds between the end of Asr and the start of Maghrib)
